  <h2>Invitation</h2>
  <p>It’s the fullness of time, overseas Chinese come home!</p>
</header>
<p>
  <b>May 30th - June 1st, 2019</b><br/>
  <b>Austin, Texas, USA</b><br/>

  In the Bible, the 70th year is a fullness of time, a critical year marking the end of a generational cycle & the beginning of a new one.<br/>

  First, it has been 70 years since the establishment of the State of Israel, a time of fulfillment of many prophecies! The global church cannot exclude itself from God’s work in Israel, and neither can the Chinese church! Then, 2019 is the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, so overseas Chinese must not miss this critical time of redemption & restoration! God has chosen the Chinese to stand in their place at this time & He is granting them unprecedented oneness. Seeing the Chinese in Asia rise up has also awakened the overseas Chinese. Like Queen Esther in diaspora who was spurred & awakened by her kinsmen Mordecai, we Chinese in North America & the nations are rising up to stand in our place and align with God’s endtime purpose and His destiny for the Chinese!<br/>

  In this fullness of time, God has prompted us to call a gathering of overseas Chinese in Austin, Texas, USA, to further continue & expand His work from the Esther Arise Gathering in 2017 Nov 11!<br/>

  So we are here from the four corners of the globe, eager to meet you because we are family! Let us come together to satisfy our Father’s heart & encounter Him!<br/>

  With great anticipation,<br/>

<h2>About Homecoming Gathering</h2>

`video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1j0eSEbR4c`

<p>
  Homecoming gathering is a group of pastors and believers from nations who have been walking together—praying, worshipping, fellowshipping and crying out to God together to see the glory of God to come to this nation. It is open to the Body of Christ to walk together as family to whatever extent the Lord releases them to do so. Our heart is to embrace all believers, all denominations, and para-churches. And just like a family, we desire to walk together with each generation. Old and young alike, all have an important role to play in a family, and all are needed to make a family complete.<br/>

  Unlike a conference with pre-determined speakers and pre-set teachings, in a gathering believers answer a call from the Lord to come together to worship and wait before Him, posturing themselves to hear what the Spirit is saying to the Church. A team of seasoned mature leaders provides spiritual oversight and protection in the meetings, as they walk together to discern what the Lord is saying through the body and facilitate the working of the Holy Spirit.
